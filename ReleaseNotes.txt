Version 1.1.2

On a Windows PC the editor did not reliably save medialists. I have added a workaround which asks the user to re-try  the save it seems to always work on the second or third time.

unclutter must be installed before using Pi Presents  (sudo apt-get install unclutter)

In my tests liveshow coped well with deleting tracks at any time. However I can see there are potential problems as files could be deleted at the moment they are being read. If you have problems please report them and I will improve the mutual exclusion.

Take care when modifying resources.cfg, little error checking is done by Pi Presents.
