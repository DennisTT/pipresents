Version 1.1.1

unclutter must be installed before using Pi Presents - sudo apt-get install unclutter

In my tests liveshow coped well with deleting tracks at any time. However I can see there possible problems as the files could be deleted at the moment they are being read. If you have problems please report them and I will improve the mutual exclusion.

Take care when modifying resources.cfg, little error checking is done.
