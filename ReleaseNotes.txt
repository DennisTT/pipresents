Version 1.1.1a

!!!!! The Editor is unreliable when used on a Windows PC!!!!!

unclutter must be installed before using Pi Presents  (sudo apt-get install unclutter)

In my tests liveshow coped well with deleting tracks at any time. However I can see there are potential problems as files could be deleted at the moment they are being read. If you have problems please report them and I will improve the mutual exclusion.

Take care when modifying resources.cfg, little error checking is done by Pi Presents.
