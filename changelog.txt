Version 1.1.0 - 20/1/2013
Added validation of profiles - all fields except for fonts and colours are validated.
Added a system to check compatibiity between profiles, editor and Pi Presents. Uses first 2 digits of Version:
   First digit - complete re-write.
   Second digit - Incremented when profile definition has changed
   Third digit - modifications that do not change the profile interface.
Images can now display a text overlay - show-text and track-text
Images can  be paused using 'space', 'p' or spacebar
Reversed the polarity of PIR input as burglar alarm PIR's have nc connections.
New image and message tracks now have blank durations so they inherit from show by default.
Fixed bug in editor where add show and add track produced linked tracks.
Other minor improvements
